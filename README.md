## 2. Automatic Generation Control (AGC)

> Automatic generation control (AGC) is the name given to a control system having three major objectives: [_wood2014power_]
> 1. To hold system frequency at or very close to a specified nominal value (e.g., 50 or 60 Hz).
> 2. To maintain the correct value of interchange power between control areas. 3. To maintain each unitâ€™s generation at the most economic value.
