## Automatic Generation Control (AGC)

> Automatic generation control (AGC) is the name given to a control system
> having three major objectives: [^1]
> 
> 1. To hold system frequency at or very close to a specified nominal value
>    (e.g., 50 or 60 Hz).
> 2. To maintain the correct value of interchange power between control areas.
>    3. To maintain each unit’s generation at the most economic value.
